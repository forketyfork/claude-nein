# Claude Code Spend Monitor - macOS Menu Bar App Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Build a macOS menu bar application that displays real-time Claude Code spending with a simple menu bar icon showing today's spend and a dropdown with detailed breakdowns for today/week/month periods.

## Technical Architecture
- **Framework**: Swift + SwiftUI for native macOS experience
- **Menu Bar**: NSStatusItem with custom icon and menu
- **Data Source**: Monitor Claude Code JSONL files in config directories
- **Real-time Updates**: File system monitoring + periodic refresh
- **Cost Calculation**: Implement pricing logic with LiteLLM API integration

## Implementation Steps

- [x] "Refresh" menu item for manual updates
  - [x] "Refresh Pricing" menu item
  - [x] Display pricing last fetched time in menu
  - [x] "Grant/Revoke Access" menu items for home directory permissions
  - [x] Permission status icon in menu (improved UX with per-directory bookmarks)
  - [x] "Reload Database" menu item with confirmation dialog for clearing all cached data
  - [x] "Quit" menu item
- [x] Style menu for native macOS look:
  - [x] Use system fonts and colors

  - [x] Support dark/light mode

### Phase 7: Settings & Preferences
